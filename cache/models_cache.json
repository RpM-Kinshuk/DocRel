        "abstract": "several g20 economies have since 2009 committed to phasing out inefficient fossil fuel  coal oil and gas  subsidies that limit the potential attainment of the sustainable development goals sdgs dealing with climate change means embracing a global decarbonisation agenda moreover for some this is regardless of the distributional consequences mainly fossil fuelproducing economies developed or developing this chapter analyses how fiscal tax arrangements including producer subsidies work in the upstream oil and gas industry and the main reasons for their setup which include encouraging foreign and domestic investments fiscal stability we also discuss the implementation pathways of these systems like accelerated tax deductions and cost recovery among others lastly we also discuss the alignments and misalignments of these tax systems visvis advancing the attainment of the sdgs particularly sdg 7 affordable and clean energy sdg 9 industry innovation and infrastructure sdg 12 responsible consumption and production and sdg 13 climate action overall we find that there is an opportunity to review and better align some of these upstream oil and gas producer subsidies to the attainment of the sdgs especially in meeting climate goals however this is easier said than done as many countries are likely to continue prioritising meeting their energy security needs and thus offer some of these producer subsidies especially in the wake of exogenous shocks such as the russianukraine conflict  2024 selection and editorial matter eduardo g pereira thomas l muinzer and patrick r baker individual chapters the contributors"
