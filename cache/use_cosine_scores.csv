While this digitization provides entirely new conveniences, speed, efficiency, and effectiveness in our current life, it also created a new environment, space, and ultimately a risk area for attackers. This new space is called cyberspace. There is a constant struggle between security experts and attackers in cyberspace. However, as in any environment, the attacker is always in an advantageous position. In this fight, the newest approach for security experts to catch attackers is to use technologies based on prediction and detection, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, artificial neural networks. Only in this way will it be possible to fight tens of thousands of pests that appear every second. This study focuses on detecting password attack types (brute force attack, dictionary attack, and social engineering) on real systems using Cowrie Honeypot. The logs obtained during the said attacks were used in the machine learning algorithm, and subsequent similar attacks were classified with the help of artificial intelligence. Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used to classify these attacks. As a result of this research, it was determined that the password attacks carried out by the attacker were phishing attacks, dictionary attacks, or brute force attacks with high success rates. Determining the type of password attack will play a critical role in determining the measures to be taken by the target institution to close the vulnerabilities in which the attack can be carried out. It has been evaluated that the study will make significant contributions to cybersecurity and password attacks.",0.30509424

We searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to May 12, 2021. We identified 13 studies enrolling 5,048 patients. We extracted the general characteristics of each study; the sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) of the ML models developed as well as the features identified as important by the ML models. We identified 12 studies with 5,048 patients that included ML algorithms for adenomas, three with 1807 patients specifically for acromegaly, and five with 2105 patients specifically for Cushing's disease. Nearly all were single-institution studies. The studies used a heterogeneous mix of ML algorithms and features to build predictive models. All papers reported an AUC greater than 0.7, which indicates clinical utility. ML algorithms have the potential to predict postoperative outcomes of transsphenoidal surgery and can improve patient care. Ensemble algorithms and neural networks were often top performers when compared with other ML algorithms. Biochemical and preoperative features were most likely to be selected as important by ML models. Inexplicability remains a challenge, but algorithms such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation or Shapley value can increase explainability of ML algorithms.

In addition, these models rarely take into consideration the impact of crowd chaos on crowd evacuation. In order to study the swarm intelligence evacuation model describing the evacuation behaviors of different groups, by integrating various swarm intelligence algorithms, and taking into account the impact of crowd chaos on evacuation, a crowd evacuation model based on hybrid artificial bee colony-bat algorithm with entropy correction was proposed. Firstly, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for group partition. The evacuees were divided into group leader, group members, and disorganized people. Next, according to the characteristics of each type of evacuees, the group leader was described based on bat algorithm, the group members based on artificial bee colony algorithm, and the disorganized people based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, the evacuation entropy that quantitatively describes the degree of crowd chaos was introduced to correct the position of the group leader, and the evacuation model based on hybrid artificial bee colony-bat algorithm with entropy correction was thus constructed. Simulation results show that the model could well simulate group evacuation, which was basically consistent with the real shape of group evacuation, and the evacuation efficiency was improved by means of group evacuation to some extent. With the introduction of the evacuation entropy for correction, the group leader could guide the group members to avoid the chaotic area ahead, prevent the excessive concentration of evacuees, and enhance the safety and rapidity of evacuation.",0.28383285

In this way, much better diversity and convergence can be obtained. Second, we propose a direction-guided offspring generation strategy, where a type of potential directions is designed to generate the promising solutions which can balance the convergence and diversity of the obtained solutions and improve the effectiveness of the algorithm significantly.

The IS samples located in unimportant regions are removed in order to improve the efficiency of approximating the surrogate LSSs. The optimal training points are selected from the truncated IS samples to update the Kriging model. After several training iterations, the surrogate LSSs are convergent.

However, most of these models undergo performance degradation when multiple tasks with incremental data are presented. Inspired by learning of the brain, in this study, we propose a lifelong learning model which extracts knowledge and utilizes the previously learned knowledge to solve the current problem. In the proposed model, firstly, we exploit various deep convolution blocks to extract non-trivial features from images, then a code fragment based learning classifier system with a rich knowledge encoding scheme is devised for knowledge extraction, transfer and reuse. We validate the proposed model with 2 incremental learning scenarios: (i) new instances (ii) new classes, on underwater synsets of the benchmark ImageNet dataset.

However, recommendation models that only use ratings, such as collaborative filtering, are vulnerable to data sparsity. And models only using review information will also suffer from the sparsity of reviews. On one hand, most ratings and reviews are interrelated and complementary, reviews may explain why a user gives a high or low rating to an item. On the other hand, ratings and reviews are numerical and textual information, respectively, and they reflect the preference of the user from a coarse-grained level and a fine-grained level A user may comment positively about some aspects of an item, even he gives a very low score to this item. There are specific information among each of them because of their heterogeneity. Therefore, it is possible to learn more accurate representation of users and items by effectively integrating ratings and text reviews from different views, that is, shared-view and specific-view. In this paper, we propose a Shared-view and Specific-view Information extraction model for Recommendation (SSIR), which integrates the information from reviews and interaction matrix to predict ratings Our model has two key components, including shared-view information extraction and specific-view exploitation. From the perspective of shared-view, SSIR jointly minimizes the loss of confusion adversarial and rating prediction loss to extract the shared information from reviews and user–item interaction matrix. For the specific-view part, SSIR applies orthogonal constraints on shared-view and specific-view modules to extract the discriminative features from reviews and interaction data. We fuse the features extracted from these two views to predict the final ratings. In addition, we use auxiliary reviews to deal with the sparsity problem of reviews. Experimental results on eight datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which could adapt to the recommendation scenarios with fewer reviews and ratings.",0.23833627

There have been numerous studies on the stock market among researchers to predict stock prices, and a growing number of studies employed machine learning or deep learning techniques on the stock market predictions with the advent of big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques. However, making accurate predictions of stock price direction remains difficult because stock prices are inherently complex, nonlinear, nonstationary, and sometimes too irrational to be predictable. Despite the wealth of information, previous prediction systems often overlooked key indicators and the importance of feature engineering. This study proposes a hybrid GA-XGBoost prediction system with an enhanced feature engineering process consisting of feature set expansion, data preparation, and optimal feature set selection using the hybrid GA-XGBoost algorithm. This study experimentally verifies the importance of feature engineering process in stock price direction prediction by comparing obtained feature sets to original dataset as well as improving prediction performance to outperform benchmark models. Specifically, the most significant accuracy increment comes from feature expansion that adds 67 technical indicators to the original historical stock price data. This study also produces a parsimonious optimal feature set using the GA-XGBoost algorithm that can achieve the desired performance with substantially fewer features. Consequently, this study empirically proves that a successful prediction performance largely depends on a deliberate combination of feature engineering processes with a baseline learning model to make a good balance and harmony between the curse of dimensionality and the blessing of dimensionality.",0.1630727

Thanks to modern computing devices, it is possible to implement actively artificial intelligence and computer-assisted learning methods that allow achieving high efficiency in data processing. A study was conducted and an algorithm for diagnosing the technical condition based on an artificial neural network was developed. A model based on a multilayer perceptron is proposed, which allows evaluating the technical condition of a high-voltage power transformer. The result of the technical diagnostics of the model is the assignment of the condition to one of the five classes, proposed by the guidelines presented by the International Council on Large Electrical Systems. The methodology is presented on the example of a 250 MVA transformer with a certain defect history, which allowed us to show the reliability and validity of the obtained results. It is shown that the use of the proposed model makes it possible to achieve accuracy in determining the technical condition of 0.95. The introduction of this model into an automated monitoring and diagnostics system will allow assessing the technical condition of electrical equipment in real time with sufficient accuracy.",0.17135686

Big data collection, processing and analysis technologies are already being actively implemented. Further use of big data will help with a variety of tasks, such as optimization and process monitoring, quality control of equipment and produced parts, modeling and forecasting of the facility operation and other mechanical engineering challenges. A new method of creation of a two-level neural network structure is proposed, designed to solve a number of problems by training individual neural networks for each subset of data used in the task at hand. This method combines two levels of information processing: The first level of the neural network classifier and the second level, which includes several neural network analyzers. Depending on the specific subject area and the data sets available, it is possible to use the method to solve various problems in mechanical engineering. The method allows to add new neural network analyzers and expand the scope of application. The practical application of the method in solving the problem of text message sentiment analysis is shown and an example of the Python programming language software implementation of the two-level structure is given. Use cases for the two-level structure method in mechanical engineering tasks are proposed. In addition, the proposed method can be used as a part of the hybrid intelligent information system that includes mivar expert systems. Combining neural networks with mivar expert systems as part of a hybrid intelligent information system is a promising direction for the development of artificial intelligence for mechanical engineering.",0.19208616
