            "Authors": "Rafa N.; Khalid R.; Uddin S.M.N.",
            "abstract": "Despite the pivotal role of energy in shaping daily life, its intricate dynamics remain underexplored within humanitarian contexts. This study examines the energy landscape within the Rohingya refugee camps, highlighting the implications of energy poverty for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using the energy justice framework, the study identifies three forms of energy injustice experienced by the Rohingya refugees- distributional, recognition, and procedural injustices- arising from inadequate distribution of energy access, financing and resources scarcity, non-recognition of refugees' energy needs, and poor representation of the refugees in energy-related decision-making. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the study illustrates how these injustices cause extreme energy poverty, leading to adverse impacts on food security, health, gender equality, education, and overall living conditions, undermining several SDGs and underscoring the need for integrating energy justice principles into humanitarian strategies. The study concludes that the failure to address these energy injustices perpetuates a cycle of energy poverty and disenfranchisement of refugees, emphasizing the necessity of collaborative governance structures that actively involve refugees in decision-making processes. It further calls for multi-scalar and multi-sectoral collaborations, holistic energy planning approaches, and diversified funding strategies. As we navigate the intricacies of energy poverty in displaced settings, this research raises critical questions about the future of energy transitions for camp-based refugee populations in protracted crises, urging further exploration of the broader geopolitical, social, and environmental factors influencing energy justice in such contexts. \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

            "abstract": "With the increasing attention to environmental degradation and sustainable development goals, the low-carbon energy transition has emerged as a focal point in both academic and political realms. This research examines, under the framework of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, the impact of low-carbon energy transition, natural resource rents, and economic growth on environmental performance. Additionally, it delves into the regulatory role of green finance and transition finance in the nexus between low-carbon energy transition and environmental performance. The research findings reveal that the influence of low-carbon energy transition, economic growth, and natural resource rents on environmental performance exhibits distinct regional heterogeneity. The research also verifies the premise that the Environmental Kuznets Curve exists exclusively in the eastern area of China. Further investigation indicates that sustainable finance plays a crucial regulatory role in the relationship between low-carbon energy transition and environmental performance. According to these results, the paper suggests that provinces should establish dual environmental and economic goals and optimize financial policy design. Moreover, governments and enterprises should achieve sustainable development goals through means such as technological innovation, regulatory frameworks, and market mechanisms. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",
