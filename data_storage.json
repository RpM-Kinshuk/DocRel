            "abstract": "Developing information and technology has caused the digitization of data in all areas of our lives. While this digitization provides entirely new conveniences, speed, efficiency, and effectiveness in our current life, it also created a new environment, space, and ultimately a risk area for attackers. This new space is called cyberspace. There is a constant struggle between security experts and attackers in cyberspace. However, as in any environment, the attacker is always in an advantageous position. In this fight, the newest approach for security experts to catch attackers is to use technologies based on prediction and detection, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, artificial neural networks. Only in this way will it be possible to fight tens of thousands of pests that appear every second. This study focuses on detecting password attack types (brute force attack, dictionary attack, and social engineering) on real systems using Cowrie Honeypot. The logs obtained during the said attacks were used in the machine learning algorithm, and subsequent similar attacks were classified with the help of artificial intelligence. Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been used to classify these attacks. As a result of this research, it was determined that the password attacks carried out by the attacker were phishing attacks, dictionary attacks, or brute force attacks with high success rates. Determining the type of password attack will play a critical role in determining the measures to be taken by the target institution to close the vulnerabilities in which the attack can be carried out. It has been evaluated that the study will make significant contributions to cybersecurity and password attacks."

            "abstract": "The \u201cdigital package\u201d proposed by the European Commission in December 2020 marks the affirmation of the Union as a center of sovereign power over the digital environment, not only with respect to the large multinational companies that manage the flow of information on the Internet, but also with respect to the national States, which are gradually losing the possibility to regulate the phenomena occurring online independently. To achieve this goal, the European Commission has moved mainly along three lines: 1) the data sharing for the development of artificial intelligence systems; 2) a greater control over gatekeepers (i.e., digital platforms that can condition access to the market) in order to prevent them from abusing their dominant position; 3) a greater accountability of digital intermediaries for the contents produced and disseminated by the end users of their services, paying particular attention to large-scale platforms. This undermines the principle of provider neutrality, sanctioned by the European directive on electronic commerce dating back to 2000. Through the reaffirmation of its digital sovereignty, the European Union seems to reclaim its nature as an area of rights and freedom, capable to ensure an anthropocentric and personalist governance of innovation."

            "abstract": "The digital transition is one of the main tasks of the European Commission in its current five-year establishment, 2019-2024. With the wider objectives of strengthening the social dimension of Europe and shifting to a data-agile economy, several European legislative proposals aimed at regulating the vast digital subject were submitted in the last years by the Union, in the areas of data privacy, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and digital platforms. The latest attempt in this direction \u2013 the European Commission proposal for a reform of the European Digital Space of December 2020, articulated in the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act \u2013 provides a set of new rules for all digital services and plat-forms. Particular attention is paid to the role of algorithms, the implications for the quality of information and countries\u2019 democratic stability and the need for greater transparency of those mechanisms of ranking and selection underlying algorithmic performance. This multidisciplinary paper precisely focuses on the understanding of the algorithmic power, its effectiveness and the consequences it brings on our daily lives. It will examine the EU legal framework and guidelines in the digital sector and, through a review of the sociological and media studies\u2019 literature, it will draw valuable interpretative and conceptual tools on the theme of the power of the algorithm and its declinations. Through the definition both of the theoretical framework, built with the analysis of media studies\u2019 contributions on the theme of algorithm and the European legal framework in the digital field, we will examine the connections between algorithmic power, construction of meaning and disinformation, with the aim of understanding the extent of the change that the transparent algorithm would imply."

In this study, we used tree-based regression models, one of the machine learning methods, to determine and predict the effect of health indicators of 191 countries on the human development index (HDI) between 2014 and 2018 years. When tree-based regression models were compared according to model performance criteria, it was found that the best model was the gradient boosting model with the highest R2 = 0.9962 and the smallest RMSE = 0.0094. With the gradient boosting model, the three most important variables to HDI are; current health expenditure per capita, physicians and nurses, and midwives, respectively. By selecting the ten countries with the highest HDI values and Turkey, HDI values were estimated for 2018-2019 with a gradient boosting model. The countries for which HDI values are best predicted by the gradient boosting method are Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Turkey, Ireland, Germany, Australia, and China."

This is especially true for international law, which seemingly remains indecisive regarding whether it has a role to play at all. This article aims at mapping out converging points between AI and international law. Through separating key elements of the definition and nature of AI, the possibility of its legal personality and the means by which AI may become a subject of international law are analysed. Utilizing various modalities regarding legal personality, such as that of inanimate objects, corporations and natural persons, the paper presents avenues for if and when decision-makers want to regulate the field. Last, the advantages and problems with bestowing legal personality and the potential future directions of international regulation are observed."

            "abstract": "Background Breast cancer is the most prevailing heterogeneous disease among females characterized with distinct molecular subtypes and varied clinicopathological features. With the emergence of various artificial intelligence techniques especially machine learning, the breast cancer research has attained new heights in cancer detection and prognosis. Objective Recent development in computer driven diagnostic system has enabled the clinicians to improve the accuracy in detecting various types of breast tumors. Our study is to develop a computer driven diagnostic system which will enable the clinicians to improve the accuracy in detecting various types of breast tumors. Methods In this article, we proposed a breast cancer classification model based on the hybridization of machine learning approaches for classifying triple-negative breast cancer and non-triple negative breast cancer patients with clinicopathological features collected from multiple tertiary care hospitals/centers. Results The results of genetic algorithm and support vector machine (GA-SVM) hybrid model was compared with classics feature selection SVM hybrid models like support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), LASSO-SVM, Grid-SVM, and linear SVM. The classification results obtained from GA-SVM hybrid model outperformed the other compared models when applied on two distinct hospital-based datasets of patients investigated with breast cancer in North West of African subcontinent. To validate the predictive model accuracy, 10-fold cross-validation method was applied on all models with the same multicentered datasets. The model performance was evaluated with well-known metrics like mean squared error, logarithmic loss, F1-score, area under the ROC curve, and the precision-recall curve. Conclusion The hybrid machine learning model can be employed for breast cancer subtypes classification that could help the medical practitioners in better treatment planning and disease outcome."

Together with the institutions running on conventional educational system, military colleges have also embrassed this new technology. This study assessed the current status of adoption, challenges and strategies of using AI based e-learning system in the UAE military based colleges. The study was carried out based on the perception of the teachers and students of Joint Command and Staff College (JCSC). A set of the questions was presented to the 50 teachers and 157 students for highlighting the level of agreement for each question. The questions were devided into three sections as level of adoption, challenges, and strategies in using AI based e-learning education system. The study found that for current status, AI and e-learning have got siginificant popularity in the education system due to high level of flexibility. While the challenges, the lack of human relations between teacher and student is reported as the major challenge faced in adoption of AI based e-learning system. Finally, for the strategies, the respondents indicated that the UAE is trying to develop plans and alternatives to address the discrepancy between traditional teaching and artificial intelligence methods adapted in the military college. This study provides a valuable source of information for devicing strategies to promote the uses of these modern tools and also motivate the students to get the maximum benefits of AI and e-learning technologies."

            "abstract": "The SinGAN is one of generative adversarial networks that can be trained on a single nature image. It has poor ability to learn more global features from nature image, and losses much local detail information when it generates arbitrary size image sample. To solve the problem, a non-linear function is firstly proposed to control downsampling ratio that is ratio between the size of current image and the size of next downsampled image, to increase the ratio with increase of the number of downsampling. This makes the low-resolution images obtained by downsampling have higher proportion in all downsampled images. The low-resolution images usually contain much global information. Therefore, it can help the model to learn more global feature information from downsampled images. Secondly, the attention mechanism is introduced to the generative network to increase the weight of effective image information. This can make the network learn more local details. Besides, in order to make the output image more natural, the TVLoss function is introduced to the loss function of SinGAN, to reduce the difference between adjacent pixels and smear phenomenon for the output image. A large number of experimental results show that our proposed model has better performance than other methods in generating random samples with fixed size and arbitrary size, image harmonization and editing."

            "abstract": "The importance and necessity of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, has recently been emphasized. In fact, artificial intelligence, such as intelligent surveillance cameras and other security systems, is used to solve various problems or provide convenience, providing solutions to problems that humans traditionally had to manually deal with one at a time. Among them, information security is one of the domains where the use of artificial intelligence is especially needed because the frequency of occurrence and processing capacity of dangerous codes exceeds the capabilities of humans. Therefore, this study intends to examine the definition of artificial intelligence and machine learning, its execution method, process, learning algorithm, and cases of utilization in various domains, particularly the cases and contents of artificial intelligence technology used in the field of information security. Based on this, this study proposes a method to apply machine learning technology to the method of classifying and detecting malware that has rapidly increased in recent years. The proposed methodology converts software programs containing malicious codes into images and creates training data suitable for machine learning by preparing data and augmenting the dataset. The model trained using the images created in this manner is expected to be effective in classifying and detecting malware."

            "abstract": "Coal plays a dominant role in China\u2019s energy structure and has made great contributions to China\u2019s national economic develop? ment, and it is an important part of China\u2019s energy strategic security. The spatial and temporal characteristics of coal energy in China andits political and economic environment at home and abroad determine the current pattern of coal resources development in the western eco? logically fragile mining areas, which has become an important strategic base for coal energy supply in China. According to the existing re? search results, large-scale and high-intensity development has exceeded the ecological environment carrying capacity of some miningareas in the region, and it is very likely to cause irreversible damage to the ecological environment. The characteristics of the occurrence ofenergy in China determine that the region\u2019s coal resources must be developed in an orderly and scientific manner, and it is the key scientificproblem to consider the national energy strategic security and long-term stability and restoration of ecological environment. Among them,the popularization and application of water conservation mining technology and gob water storage (groundwater reservoir) technologies havealleviated the contradiction between coal mining and ecological environment protection to a certain extent. However, in the long run, thiscontradiction will accompany the entire life cycle of coal mining. It is believed that a coordination center for coal resources developmentand environmental protection in the ecologically fragile mining areas in the west of China should be established, with the leading and coor? dinating by the National Development and Reform Commission as well as the National Energy Administration. With the coal mining and ec? ological environment protection as the main line, the medium and long-term plan of coal mining considering the bearing capacity of the ec? ological environment should be formulated, and the full demonstration and evaluation before mining and continuous monitoring during andafter mining established. At the same time, it is necessary to increase the scientific and technological investment in coal development, andsolve the contradiction between coal mining and ecological environment protection by interdisciplinary integration of coal mining, ecologicalenvironment protection and monitoring, artificial intelligence and so on."

            "abstract": "Innovations and changes in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) affect almost every sector, accelerate the fields and increase the quality of products and services. Especially the constantly developing software and web technologies provide the emergence of innovative ideas and inventions and open new horizons. Artificial Intelligence (AI), one of the technologies that has developed since the middle of the 20th century and is the focal point in today\u2019s world, has a structure that can realize the dream of intelligent beings with thinking and reasoning functions, which human beings have dreamed of since the beginning of history. This technology, which is thought to bring about great transformations in almost every field, has the potential to fundamentally change libraries, which are information centers, in terms of both service understanding and institutional structure. In this study, AI implementations in the field of AI and libraries were examined based on the literature; the perceptions, awareness and expectations of university librarians about AI technology and implementations was tried to be determined. For this purpose, a questionnaire consisting of 18 questions was applied to all librarians (160 people) working in university libraries in Ankara, and the research data were obtained from 110 librarians who volunteered to participate in the study. These data were analyzed through SPSS program. In this study, where the descriptive method was used, it was found that the level of knowledge and skills of librarians about artificial intelligence technologies and applications was low; and it was determined that there are training needs to develop them. It is supposed that this study will provide opportunities by giving information about new technologies that can be used in libraries; raise awareness about AI and give ideas and contribute to librarians and administrators while planning the training to be held in libraries."

The Gulf Region is investing extensively in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), leading, with Saudi Arabia, the rush for AI in the Middle East. Uses of AI are multiple and its production and management provides great economic advantages. AI contributes to the development of automation process, business management, project engineering, blockchain technology, customer services management and marketing data analysis. According to technology developers, the use of AI will be extremely helpful to people, in terms of services and better job distribution. This article analyses literature and data appearing around the impact of AI worldwide and in the Gulf, providing a rational argumentation in which we highlight the discrepancy between what is desirable for citizens and what responds to marketing needs. The results of the analysis give structure to a framework helping developers and users of AI to make responsible choices and select planning investments beneficial to the Gulf Region."

            "abstract": "The purpose of this analysis is to assess the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the prediction of postoperative outcomes, including complications, recurrence, and death in transsphenoidal surgery. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically reviewed all papers that used at least one ML algorithm to predict outcomes after transsphenoidal surgery. We searched Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for studies published prior to May 12, 2021. We identified 13 studies enrolling 5,048 patients. We extracted the general characteristics of each study; the sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) of the ML models developed as well as the features identified as important by the ML models. We identified 12 studies with 5,048 patients that included ML algorithms for adenomas, three with 1807 patients specifically for acromegaly, and five with 2105 patients specifically for Cushing's disease. Nearly all were single-institution studies. The studies used a heterogeneous mix of ML algorithms and features to build predictive models. All papers reported an AUC greater than 0.7, which indicates clinical utility. ML algorithms have the potential to predict postoperative outcomes of transsphenoidal surgery and can improve patient care. Ensemble algorithms and neural networks were often top performers when compared with other ML algorithms. Biochemical and preoperative features were most likely to be selected as important by ML models. Inexplicability remains a challenge, but algorithms such as local interpretable model-agnostic explanation or Shapley value can increase explainability of ML algorithms. Our analysis shows that ML algorithms have the potential to greatly assist surgeons in clinical decision making."

Furthermore, the potential interaction between machines and vulnerable subjects, such as consumers or patients, is a compounding factor, which implies even greater risk. This is precisely why it is necessary to analyse the legal and ethical consequences of the use of intelligent robots in our society."

Digital technology can also be applied to solving humanity\u2019s big problems, such as the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their 169 targets for the 2030 agenda. In this article, I will comment on different cases of use and application of Artificial Intelligence and robotics aimed at achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and what ethical principles must guide their application so that AI achieves the ambitious 2030 agenda. I will also comment on Spain\u2019s action plan and national strategy to fulfil the 2030 agenda and how it incorporates ICT."

To do so, they must first understand, define and delimit it, and then explain and analyse it in order to propose fair and equitable solutions. This global concept encompasses multiple realities, each with its own characteristics and specific impact, in particular in the field of work as a source of personal and social identity. Public and private institutions, as well as international, European and national ones such as the OECD, ILO, WEF, EU, among others, have been doing regular studies, reports and analyses of the situation for some time. With regard to Robotics, they have gone beyond the specific scope of the industrial sector to try to identify the impact of technologies that replicate human-like cognitive processes in machines, seen from a triple perspective: ethical, legal and socio-economic. Thus, emphasis is placed on their effects on the configuration and definition of work; on the different models or types of work, profoundly altered today by automation or digitalisation; and on the conditions in which workers provide their services. From this triple perspective, admitting that robots and Artificial Intelligence systems are one of the great truly disruptive inventions of the digital environment and that they are here to stay, this study focuses on Inclusive robotics, thus contributing to an understanding of the current technological change by reflecting on some of the issues it raises for the law."

This paper will attempt to turn this reasoning on its head and, focusing on Artificial Intelligence, propose suitable criteria for this technology and many others to be developed and applied appropriately to fundamental rights, in general, and privacy in particular. Within these criteria, an analysis will be made of what the explainability of the aforementioned technology should provide (a requirement introduced by different groups of experts) and some additional concepts, such as the possibility/necessity of controlling (to the point of being able to stop an Artificial Intelligence system at any time) and auditing Artificial Intelligence systems, will be explored in greater depth. In order to carry out the aforementioned in-depth study, we will use what are known as protection goals (availability, confidentiality, integrity, transparency, unlinkability, and ability to intervene) and the principles of Cyberethics, including a special reference to the sustainability and resilience of these types of systems."

            "abstract": "Introduction Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited genetic disease that has an extremely elevated cardiovascular risk because of their significantly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Nutritional intervention is needed in improving LDL cholesterol control in patients with FH but requires a considerable burden in manpower. Artificial intelligence (AI)-supported and mobile-supported nutritional intervention using this technique may be an alternative approach to traditional nutritional counselling in person. This study aims to test the hypothesis that AI-supported nutritional counselling is more effective in reducing LDL cholesterol than the in-person, face-to-face method in terms of improving LDL cholesterol control in patients with FH. Methods and analysis This is a single-centre, unblinded, cross-over, randomised controlled study comparing the efficacy of AI-supported automated nutrition therapy with that of conventional human nutrition counselling in patients with FH. Patients with FH are recruited and randomly assigned to AI-supported nutrition counselling (n=30) and to face-to face nutrition counselling (n=30). We are using an Asken, a mobile application that has been specially modified for this study so that it follows the recommendations by the Japan Atherosclerosis Society. We started patient recruitment on 1 September 2020, and is scheduled to continue until 31 December 2022. Ethics and dissemination This study is being conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects, and all other applicable laws and guidelines in Japan. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kanazawa University on 13 April 2020 (IRB no. 2623-3); all recruited patients are required to provide written informed consent. We will disseminate the final results at international conferences and in a peer-reviewed journal."

However, the large structural freedom of \u03c0-conjugated polymers and molecules makes it difficult to explore with limited resources. Machine learning, which is based on rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology, is a high-throughput method to accelerate the speed of material design and process optimization; however, it suffers from limitations in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability, data collection, and available data (particularly, experimental data). This recognition motivates the present Perspective, which focuses on utilizing the experimental data set for ML to efficiently aid OPV research. This Perspective discusses the trends in ML-OPV publications, the NFA category, and the effects of data size and explanatory variables (fingerprints or Mordred descriptors) on the prediction accuracy and explainability, which broadens the scope of ML and would be useful for the development of next-generation solar cell materials."

In particular, we focus on using the Theorema system in a software-enhanced logic-course for students in computer science or artificial intelligence. The purpose of using logic-software in our teaching is not to teach students the proper use of a particular piece of software. In contrast, we try to employ certain software in order to spark students' motivation and to support their understanding of logic principles they are supposed to understand after having passed the course. In a sense, we try to let the software act as a logic-tutor, the software is not an additional subject we teach."

            "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography Angiography (OCT-A) represents a revolution in the noninvasive evaluation of retinal and choroidal circulation especially in detecting early clinical signs of diabetic retinal disease (DRD). With appropriate use, OCT-A characteristics and measurements have the potential to become new imaging biomarkers in managing and treating DRD. Major challenges include (a) provision of standardized outputs from different OCT-A instruments providing standardized terminology to correctly interpret data; (b) the presence of artifacts; (c) the absence of standardized grading or interpretation method in the evaluation of DRD, similar to that already established in fundus photography; and (d) establishing how OCT-A might be able to provide surrogate markers to demonstrate blood retinal barrier breakdown and vascular leakage, commonly associated with DRD. In fact, OCT-A guidelines for DRD are still evolving. The outputs of quantitative OCT-A data offer a unique opportunity to develop tools based on artificial intelligence to assist the clinicians in diagnosing, monitoring, and managing patients with diabetes. In addition, OCT-A has the potential to become a useful tool for the evaluation of cardiovascular diseases and different neurological diseases including cognitive impairment. This article written by the members of Diabetic Retinopathy expert committee of the European Vision Clinical Research network will review the available evidence on the use of OCT-A as an imaging biomarker in DRD and discuss the limits and the current application as well as future developments for its use in both clinical practice and research trials of DRD."

            "abstract": "Current swarm intelligence evacuation models only consider single classic swarm intelligence, which is insufficient to describe the complex behavior characteristics of crowd evacuation. In addition, these models rarely take into consideration the impact of crowd chaos on crowd evacuation. In order to study the swarm intelligence evacuation model describing the evacuation behaviors of different groups, by integrating various swarm intelligence algorithms, and taking into account the impact of crowd chaos on evacuation, a crowd evacuation model based on hybrid artificial bee colony-bat algorithm with entropy correction was proposed. Firstly, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for group partition. The evacuees were divided into group leader, group members, and disorganized people. Next, according to the characteristics of each type of evacuees, the group leader was described based on bat algorithm, the group members based on artificial bee colony algorithm, and the disorganized people based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, the evacuation entropy that quantitatively describes the degree of crowd chaos was introduced to correct the position of the group leader, and the evacuation model based on hybrid artificial bee colony-bat algorithm with entropy correction was thus constructed. Simulation results show that the model could well simulate group evacuation, which was basically consistent with the real shape of group evacuation, and the evacuation efficiency was improved by means of group evacuation to some extent. With the introduction of the evacuation entropy for correction, the group leader could guide the group members to avoid the chaotic area ahead, prevent the excessive concentration of evacuees, and enhance the safety and rapidity of evacuation."

            "abstract": "Designing efficient algorithms for the large-scale multi-objective problems (LSMOPs) is a very challenging problem currently. To tackle LSMOPs, we first design a new reference points selection strategy to enhance the diversity of algorithms and avoid the algorithm falling into local minima. The strategy selects not only a part of nondominated solutions with the largest crowding distance, but also a part of relatively uniformly distributed solutions as the reference points. In this way, much better diversity and convergence can be obtained. Second, we propose a direction-guided offspring generation strategy, where a type of potential directions is designed to generate the promising solutions which can balance the convergence and diversity of the obtained solutions and improve the effectiveness of the algorithm significantly. Based on the two proposed strategies, we propose a new effective algorithm for LSMOPs. Numerical experiments are executed on two widely used large-scale multi-objective benchmark problem sets with 200, 500 and 1000 decision variables and a comparison with five state-of-the-art algorithms is made. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is effective and can obtain significantly better solutions than the compared algorithms."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agronomic potential and genetic dissimilarity of saladette type dwarf tomato plant populations through the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The following traits were analyzed: mean fruit weight, transverse and longitudinal fruit diameter, fruit shape, pulp thickness, locule number, internode length, soluble solids content, and \u03b2-carotene, lycopene, and leaf zingiberene contents. A dendrogram obtained by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) agreed in the distinction of the BC1F3 populations from the dwarf donor parent. SOM was more consistent in identifying the genetic similarities among the BC1F3 dwarf tomato plant populations and allowed for the determination of weights of each variable in the cluster formation. The UFU SDi 13-1 BC1F3 population was revealed to be a promising option for obtaining saladette type dwarf tomato plant lines."

It combines the active learning Kriging (ALK) model with importance sampling (IS) and evolutionary multimodal-based multiobjective optimization (EMO-MMO). The surrogate limit state surfaces (LSS) for the upper and lower failure probability bounds are respectively defined considering the Kriging variance. Failure candidate solutions located in different failure regions are generated by the EMO-MMO method. Subsequently, all the most probable failure points (MPPs) are identified from those candidate solutions. The IS samples are simulated around the MPPs using the MPP-based IS method. The IS samples located in unimportant regions are removed in order to improve the efficiency of approximating the surrogate LSSs. The optimal training points are selected from the truncated IS samples to update the Kriging model. After several training iterations, the surrogate LSSs are convergent. Ultimately, a reliable and unbiased estimation of the upper and lower failure probability bounds is provided. The performance of the ALK-EMO-IS-HRA approach is verified through five application examples."

            "abstract": "The general benchmark for success of an artificial intelligence system is its ability to imitate learning of the human brain. The human brain is capable of continuous learning over a lifespan. The learned knowledge is retained, augmented, fine-tuned and reused to perform new future tasks. At present, machine learning models perform well when carefully arranged, balanced and homogenized data is presented. However, most of these models undergo performance degradation when multiple tasks with incremental data are presented. Inspired by learning of the brain, in this study, we propose a lifelong learning model which extracts knowledge and utilizes the previously learned knowledge to solve the current problem. In the proposed model, firstly, we exploit various deep convolution blocks to extract non-trivial features from images, then a code fragment based learning classifier system with a rich knowledge encoding scheme is devised for knowledge extraction, transfer and reuse. We validate the proposed model with 2 incremental learning scenarios: (i) new instances (ii) new classes, on underwater synsets of the benchmark ImageNet dataset. Experiments results which are analyzed by using paired sampled statistical t-test, show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods as well as deep convolution neural network based methods, with respect to classification accuracy."

            "abstract": "In various recommender systems, ratings and reviews are the main information to show user preferences. However, recommendation models that only use ratings, such as collaborative filtering, are vulnerable to data sparsity. And models only using review information will also suffer from the sparsity of reviews. On one hand, most ratings and reviews are interrelated and complementary, reviews may explain why a user gives a high or low rating to an item. On the other hand, ratings and reviews are numerical and textual information, respectively, and they reflect the preference of the user from a coarse-grained level and a fine-grained level A user may comment positively about some aspects of an item, even he gives a very low score to this item. There are specific information among each of them because of their heterogeneity. Therefore, it is possible to learn more accurate representation of users and items by effectively integrating ratings and text reviews from different views, that is, shared-view and specific-view. In this paper, we propose a Shared-view and Specific-view Information extraction model for Recommendation (SSIR), which integrates the information from reviews and interaction matrix to predict ratings Our model has two key components, including shared-view information extraction and specific-view exploitation. From the perspective of shared-view, SSIR jointly minimizes the loss of confusion adversarial and rating prediction loss to extract the shared information from reviews and user\u2013item interaction matrix. For the specific-view part, SSIR applies orthogonal constraints on shared-view and specific-view modules to extract the discriminative features from reviews and interaction data. We fuse the features extracted from these two views to predict the final ratings. In addition, we use auxiliary reviews to deal with the sparsity problem of reviews. Experimental results on eight datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which could adapt to the recommendation scenarios with fewer reviews and ratings."

            "abstract": "Many institutions and companies find it valuable to know how people feel about their ventures; hence, scientific research in sentiment analysis has been intensely developed over time. Automated sentiment analysis can be considered as a machine learning (ML) prediction task, with classes representing human affective states. Due to the rapid development of ML and deep learning (DL), improvements in automatic sentiment analysis performance are achieved almost every year. Since 2013, Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) has hosted a worldwide community-acknowledged competition that allows for comparisons of recent innovations. The sentiment analysis tasks focus on assessing sentiment in Twitter posts authored by various publishers and addressing multiple subjects. Our study aimed to compare selected popular and recent natural language processing methods using a new data set of Twitter posts sent to a single Twitter account. For improved comparability of our experiments with SemEval, we adopted their metrics and also deployed our models on data published for SemEval-2017. In addition, we investigated if an unsupervised ML technique applied for the detection of topics in tweets can be leveraged to improve the predictive performance of a selected transformer model. We also demonstrated how a recent explainable artificial intelligence technique can be used in Twitter sentiment analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the models\u2019 predictions. Our results show that the most recent DL language modeling approach provides the highest quality; however, this quality comes at reduced model transparency."

            "abstract": "The stock market has performed one of the most important functions in a laissez-faire economic system by gathering people, companies, and flows of money for several centuries. There have been numerous studies on the stock market among researchers to predict stock prices, and a growing number of studies employed machine learning or deep learning techniques on the stock market predictions with the advent of big data and the rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques. However, making accurate predictions of stock price direction remains difficult because stock prices are inherently complex, nonlinear, nonstationary, and sometimes too irrational to be predictable. Despite the wealth of information, previous prediction systems often overlooked key indicators and the importance of feature engineering. This study proposes a hybrid GA-XGBoost prediction system with an enhanced feature engineering process consisting of feature set expansion, data preparation, and optimal feature set selection using the hybrid GA-XGBoost algorithm. This study experimentally verifies the importance of feature engineering process in stock price direction prediction by comparing obtained feature sets to original dataset as well as improving prediction performance to outperform benchmark models. Specifically, the most significant accuracy increment comes from feature expansion that adds 67 technical indicators to the original historical stock price data. This study also produces a parsimonious optimal feature set using the GA-XGBoost algorithm that can achieve the desired performance with substantially fewer features. Consequently, this study empirically proves that a successful prediction performance largely depends on a deliberate combination of feature engineering processes with a baseline learning model to make a good balance and harmony between the curse of dimensionality and the blessing of dimensionality."

Simultaneously, groups of coordinated automated accounts/bots often use social networking sites to spread spam, rumors, bogus reviews, and fake news for targeted users or mass communication. The latest developments in the form of artificial intelligence-enabled Deepfakes have exacerbated these issues at large. Consequently, it becomes extremely relevant to review recent work concerning social spam and spammer detection to counter this issue and its effect. This paper provides a brief introduction to social spam, the spamming process, and social spam taxonomy. The comprehensive review entails several dimensionality reduction techniques used for feature selection/extraction, features used, various machine learning and deep learning techniques used for social spam and spammer detection, and their merits and demerits. Artificial intelligence and deep learning empowered Deepfake (text, image, and video) spam, and their countermeasures are also explored. Furthermore, meticulous discussions, existing challenges, and emerging issues such as robustness of detection systems, scalability, real-time datasets, evade strategies used by spammers, coordinated inauthentic behavior, and adversarial attacks on machine learning-based spam detectors, etc., have been discussed with possible directions for future research."

To this end, we introduced a novel hybrid deep learning model for stock prediction and incorporated these predictions as investors\u2019 views in Black-Litterman asset allocation model. The finding indicates that the Black-Litterman portfolio based on the predictions of the hybrid CEEMD-CNN-LSTM model constructed portfolios with high return, low extreme allocation, and low risk. Furthermore, the Black-Litterman portfolios based on the introduced prediction model outperformed the mean-variance portfolio, equal-weighted portfolio, and the Black-Litterman portfolios based on the predictions of CNN-LSTM and LSTM. This remarkable performance could be attributed to each constituting model used in the hybrid model and portfolio formation strategy."

The research distributions, knowledge bases, research hotspots, and research frontiers for MLE studies are revealed by using VOSviewer software and visualization technology. The growth of the literature related to MLE averaged 24.3% in the past two decades. A total of 3057 peer-reviewed papers from 96 countries published in 1299 different journals were identified. The USA was the most productive country, with 23.73% of the overall articles and 32.25% of the overall citations. The most active research organization was MIT, with 41 publications and 1079 citations, and the Journal of Machine Learning Research had the largest number of citations in the field of MLE. In particular, our findings indicate that the research issues of \u201crandom forests\u201d, \u201csupport vector machine\u201d, \u201cextreme learning machine\u201d, \u201cdeep learning\u201d, \u201cstatistical learning theory\u201d, and \u201cPython machine learning\u201d formed the knowledge bases of MLE from 2000 to 2019, while the research hotspots focused on applications of machine learning benchmark algorithms. Burst detection analysis results showed that more burst keywords emerged and had a higher frequency of change after 2010. This study provides an insight view of the overall research trends of MLE and may help researchers better understand this research field and predict its dynamic directions."

In the process of building smart scenic areas, we need not only fully interpret the essential connotation of smart tourism in theory, but also comprehensively apply the latest technical support to build a variety of hardware platforms in smart scenic areas, thereby meeting the needs of scenic resource protection, business management, tourism management, public services, and decision support. By proposing hypotheses about the factors influencing tourist experience, we carefully designed questionnaires, conducted online surveys among 350 tourists, refined three influencing factors after dividing the influencing factors into categories and performing correlation analysis. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between smart guide platform, smart guide robot, smart supervision platform, and tourist experience, and the above factors play a significant positive role in improving the tourist experience. By comparing the standardized coefficient values, it can be seen that standardized coefficient value of the smart guide platform has relatively high absolute value, indicating its relatively big impact. Next comes smart supervision platform and smart guide robot. It suggests that in the construction of smart scenic areas, we should: expand the construction of smart guide platform, perfect the service feedback mechanism, accelerate the upgrading of smart guide robots, highlight the advantages of artificial intelligence, and promote the intelligent, real-time, and refined development of smart supervision platforms."

The research finds that the promotion of smart tourism policy plays a positive role in promoting the national smart tourism reform plan and realizing the establishment and implementation of smart tourism scenic spots in various regions, thus driving the growth of literature quantity. Nowdays the hotspots of smart tourism research in China focus on \"smart scenic spots\"\"smart tourism\"\"scenic spot management\"and \"tourist attractions\", with increasing heat. However, core authors and institutions published fewer papers, and their cooperation with each other was scattered, so no representative academic group was formed. At the same time, the cooperation of most research institutions in China is divided by regional scope, and trans-regional, cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional cooperation needs to be further strengthened. At present, domestic researches on smart scenic spots have gone deep into the practical application level, at the present stage, the development results are uneven, and the efficiency of production, education and research institutes is not obvious. In the future, the high-quality development of smart scenic spots still needs the exploration and deepening of scientific researchers."

The algorithm mainly combines the calculation of the co-present value and the actual situation of civil aviation airports with the decision tree learning algorithm, and considers the influence of factors such as the age, gender, current operating time and current temperature of airport passengers on the browsing time of airport passengers, and then on the airport. The type of passenger browsing time is predicted to realize the optimization of the co-occurrence matrix."

            "abstract": "Assessment of the current technical condition is an important task, so the state of electrical equipment depends on its further operability. Thanks to modern computing devices, it is possible to implement actively artificial intelligence and computer-assisted learning methods that allow achieving high efficiency in data processing. A study was conducted and an algorithm for diagnosing the technical condition based on an artificial neural network was developed. A model based on a multilayer perceptron is proposed, which allows evaluating the technical condition of a high-voltage power transformer. The result of the technical diagnostics of the model is the assignment of the condition to one of the five classes, proposed by the guidelines presented by the International Council on Large Electrical Systems. The methodology is presented on the example of a 250 MVA transformer with a certain defect history, which allowed us to show the reliability and validity of the obtained results. It is shown that the use of the proposed model makes it possible to achieve accuracy in determining the technical condition of 0.95. The introduction of this model into an automated monitoring and diagnostics system will allow assessing the technical condition of electrical equipment in real time with sufficient accuracy."

            "abstract": "There is an industrial trend of increasing technological effectiveness of production and growing autonomy of factories, resulting in generation of huge amounts of raw data that can be used to improve efficiency and continuity of industrial plants operation. Big data collection, processing and analysis technologies are already being actively implemented. Further use of big data will help with a variety of tasks, such as optimization and process monitoring, quality control of equipment and produced parts, modeling and forecasting of the facility operation and other mechanical engineering challenges. A new method of creation of a two-level neural network structure is proposed, designed to solve a number of problems by training individual neural networks for each subset of data used in the task at hand. This method combines two levels of information processing: The first level of the neural network classifier and the second level, which includes several neural network analyzers. Depending on the specific subject area and the data sets available, it is possible to use the method to solve various problems in mechanical engineering. The method allows to add new neural network analyzers and expand the scope of application. The practical application of the method in solving the problem of text message sentiment analysis is shown and an example of the Python programming language software implementation of the two-level structure is given. Use cases for the two-level structure method in mechanical engineering tasks are proposed. In addition, the proposed method can be used as a part of the hybrid intelligent information system that includes mivar expert systems. Combining neural networks with mivar expert systems as part of a hybrid intelligent information system is a promising direction for the development of artificial intelligence for mechanical engineering."

            "abstract": "An approach to dynamic modeling of the predicted trajectory of movement of a displacement vessel and its continuous visualization on an electronic panel is considered, superimposed on the actual digital twin of the real scene of the environment along the course of the vessel. The hardware and software implementation of the developed approach as a decision support system for the navigator in the form of a standard option of the integrated control panel located in the wheelhouse provides an opportunity to objectively assess the safe distance to potential navigation obstacles within the ship's course at the free distance of the vessel by means of combined visualization. As part of the organizational and technical measures to ensure the safety of navigation, the proposed innovative approach to continuous joint visualization of the digital twin of the current scene of the surrounding sailing situation and the predicted trajectory of the vessel's movement acquires significant importance in the operation of automatic vessels as an option for the supervisor to intervene in the operation of an integrated automatic control system in complex navigating conditions."
